Reversible Control of Co Magnetism by Voltage-Induced Oxidation. We demonstrate that magnetic properties of ultrathin Co films adjacent to Gd2O3 gate oxides can be directly manipulated by voltage. The Co films can be reversibly changed from an optimally oxidized state with a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to a metallic state with an in-plane magnetic anisotropy or to an oxidized state with nearly zero magnetization, depending on the polarity and time duration of the applied electric fields. Consequently, an unprecedentedly large change of magnetic anisotropy energy up to 0.73 erg/cm(2) has been realized in a nonvolatile manner using gate voltages of only a few volts. These results open a new route to achieve ultralow energy magnetization manipulation in spintronic devices.
The tribological and mechanical properties of niobium carbides (NbC) bonded with cobalt or Fe<sub>3</sub>Al. The tribological and mechanical properties of niobium carbide bonded with 8 vol.-% (NbC-8Co), 12 vol.-% of cobalt (NbC-12Co) or 12 vol.-% of Fe3Al (NbC-12Fe(3)Al) are presented. Rotating discs made of metal-bonded niobium carbide were mated against alumina (99.7%) under unlubricated (dry) unidirectional sliding tests (0.1 m/s to 12.0 m/s; 22 C and 400 C) as well as in oscillation tests (f=20 Hz, Delta x=0.2 mm, 2/50/98% rel. humidity, n=10(5)/10(6) cycles). Microstructure and phase compositions were determined as well. The tribological data obtained were benchmarked with different ceramics, cermets, hard metals and thermally sprayed coatings, where NbC bonded with 8% and 12% Co presented above 7 m/s the lowest wear rates so far in such a benchmark. Binderless NbC (HP-NbC1) and the metal-bonded NbCs exhibited low wear rates under dry sliding associated with P. V high load carrying capacities. NbC-based hard metal bonded with 12 vol.-% of Fe3Al resulted in a higher hardness level than for 12 vol.-% cobalt. The tribological profile established revealed a strong position of NbC-bearing materials under tribological considerations and for closed tribosystems against established reference tribo-couples.

Slow ground state molecules from matrix isolation sublimation. We describe the generation and properties of a cryogenic beam of Li-7(2) dimers from sublimation of a neon matrix where lithium atoms have been implanted via laser ablation of solid precursors of metallic lithium or lithium hydride (LiH). Different sublimation regimes lead to pulsed molecular beams with different temperatures, densities and forward velocities. With laser absorption spectroscopy these parameters were measured using the molecular Li-7(2) (R) transitions A(1)Sigma(+)(u)(v' = 4, J' = J" + 1) <- X-1 Sigma(+)(g)(v" = 0, J" = 0, 1, 3). In a typical regime, sublimating a matrix at 16 K, translational temperatures of 6-8 K with a drift velocity of 130 m s(-1) in a free expanding pulsed beam with molecular density of 10(9) cm(-3), averaged along the laser axis, were observed. Rotational temperatures around 5-7 K were obtained. In recent experiments we were able to monitor the atomic Li signal-in the D2 line-concomitantly with the molecular signal in order to compare them as a function of the number of ablation pulses. Based on the data and a simple model, we discuss the possibility that a fraction of these molecules are being formed in the matrix, by mating atoms from different ablation pulses, which would open up the way to formation of other more interesting and difficult molecules to be studied at low temperatures. Such a source of cryogenic molecules have possible applications encompassing fundamental physics tests, quantum information studies, cold collisions, chemistry, and trapping.
Synthesis and Comparative Study of Nanoporous Palladium-Based Bimetallic Catalysts for Formic Acid Oxidation. In view of the inherent limitations of current portable technology energy sources, the implementation of micro fuel cells is becoming increasingly appealing. This has generated great interest in the development of direct formic acid micro fuel cells. In this study, nanoporous Pd and four nanoporous bimetallic Pd-M catalysts with an atomic ratio of 90:10, where M = Cd, Pb, Ir, and Pt, were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and examined for the electrochemical oxidation of formic acid. The electrocatalytic activity of these nanoporous electrode materials was studied with the use of linear sweep voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Our chronoamperometric measurements have shown that the initial electrochemical performance of the nanoporous Pd-M electrodes toward formic acid oxidation was almost independent of the alloying materials; however, the second incorporated metal strongly affected the stability of the Pd-based electrocatalysts. The mechanisms of the oxidation of formic acid were further examined with the aid of in situ electrochemical ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. For the nanoporous Pd, PdCd, and PdPb catalysts, oxidation proceeds through the direct mechanism, whereas the indirect mechanism, along with major CO poisoning, was observed in the case of the PdIr and PdPt catalysts. The incorporation of even small amounts of Pt and Ir to Pd was found to inhibit the oxidation of formic acid. On the other hand, the addition of Pb to Pd served to promote the direct mechanism, which in turn makes these Pd-based catalysts both cost and electrocatalytically more effective.
Impact of Ultrasonic Waves in Direct Electrodeposition of Nanostructured AuPt Alloy Catalyst on Carbon Substrate: Structural Characterization and Its Superior Electrocatalytic Activity for Methanol Oxidation Reaction. We have successfully developed a facile, fast, and efficient synthetic methodology for direct fabrication of stable AuPt alloy nanostructure catalyst on Toray carbon (TC) as well as glassy carbon substrates without involving any additional stabilizer or surfactant through ultrasonic-wave-assisted electrodeposition (USA-ED) using simple Au and Pt metal salt precursors in electrolyte solution. To know the real effect of ultrasonic waves on deposited particles, the same experimental methods also followed without ultrasonic waves. Size, morphology, surface composition, and surface structure of AuPt alloy nanostructures were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The observed results clearly reveal that the USA-ED method yields densely packed Pt-rich AuPt alloy nanostructure, which is a more active electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation, whereas the normal (i.e., without ultrasonic wave) ED method shows loosely packed homogeneous alloy AuPt nanostructure, which is very poor for methanol oxidation. More significantly, USA-ED of Pt-rich AuPt alloy nanostructured surface showed profound enhancement of both electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability of methanol oxidation when compared to ED of Pt nanoparticles, USA-ED of Pt nanoparticle surfaces, and also state-of-the-art commercial electrocatalysts with 30 wt % loading of Pt/C (E-TEK). These obtained results confirm that our synthetic methodology of USA-ED is effective for preparing Pt-rich AuPt alloy nanostructured electrocatalyst with excellent activity and stability in methanol oxidation reaction.
